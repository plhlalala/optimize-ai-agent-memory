    "# The Ultimate AI Agent Memory Lab: An End-to-End Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Comprehensive, Hands-On Workshop for Building Smarter Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a detailed, practical exploration of memory in AI agents. This notebook is designed to be a definitive, end-to-end guide that moves beyond theory and into tangible, working code. We will implement **nine distinct memory strategies**, from the simplest to the most conceptually advanced, using a real large language model for generation, summarization, and embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** By the end of this lab, you will have a deep, practical understanding of:\n",
    "- How each memory strategy works under the hood.\n",
    "- The specific strengths, weaknesses, and tradeoffs of each approach.\n",
    "- How to implement these strategies in Python using modern tools like `openai`, `faiss-cpu`, and `networkx`.\n",
    "- How the choice of memory architecture fundamentally changes an agent's conversational abilities, cost, and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of the Lab:**\n",
    "1.  **Part 1: The Core Framework.** We'll set up our environment, configure the LLM client, and build the foundational `AIAgent` and `BaseMemoryStrategy` classes.\n",
    "2.  **Part 2: The Memory Implementations.** We will systematically implement and demonstrate all nine memory strategies. Each strategy will have its own dedicated section with:\n",
    "    *   **Detailed Theory:** Explaining the *what*, *why*, and *how*.\n",
    "    *   **Code Implementation:** A complete, commented Python class for the strategy.\n",
    "    *   **Live Demonstration:** A practical chat session designed to showcase the strategy's unique behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intentionally lengthy and detailed to serve as a comprehensive reference. Let's begin by setting up our core components."

      "3. **Sauté aromatics**  \n",

      "4. **Add liquid**  \n",
      "   - Pour in the coconut milk and stir to dissolve the paste.  \n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Vegetables**  \n",
      "   - Add the firmer veggies first (zucchini, eggplant, bamboo shoots) for 2–3 min, then the softer ones (bell pepper, snow peas).  \n",
      "   - Return the cooked protein to the pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Simmer**  \n",
      "   - Let everything simmer for 8–10 min until veggies are tender and the curry has thickened slightly.  \n",
      "   - Stir in fresh lime juice and basil just before removing from heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Taste & adjust**  \n",
      "   - If it needs more sweetness, add a dash more brown sugar; for saltiness, a splash more fish sauce; for heat, a few extra chopped chilies.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Serve**  \n",
      "   - Spoon the curry over steamed jasmine rice, rice noodles, or cauliflower rice.  \n",

    "## Lab Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this deep dive into AI agent memory! We have successfully implemented and tested nine distinct strategies, observing firsthand how each one impacts an agent's performance, cost, and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways from this Lab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **There is No Silver Bullet:** The choice of memory is fundamentally a design decision based on your agent's purpose. A simple Q&A bot might only need a `SlidingWindow`, while a long-term personal assistant would thrive on a `Hierarchical` or `Retrieval` system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Spectrum of Complexity:** We've seen a clear progression from simple, linear stores (`Sequential`) to complex, structured data (`GraphMemory`) and dynamic systems (`OSMemory`). Increasing complexity offers more power but requires more sophisticated engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **LLMs as Tools:** Several advanced strategies (`Summarization`, `GraphMemory`, `MemoryAugmented`) don't just use the LLM for chat; they use it as an intelligent tool for processing, structuring, and compressing memory itself. This is a powerful paradigm in modern agent design.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Hybrid Systems are the Future:** The most robust production agents often use hybrid approaches. Our `HierarchicalMemory` is a prime example, combining the speed of a sliding window with the precision of retrieval. You can mix and match these strategies to create a custom memory architecture tailored to your exact needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a starting point. You can continue to explore by:\n",
    "- **Tuning Parameters:** Adjust `window_size`, `k` for retrieval, and summarization thresholds to see how they affect performance.\n",
    "- **Implementing More Advanced Logic:** Improve the promotion logic in `HierarchicalMemory` or the page-fault detection in `OSMemory` using embeddings.\n",
    "- **Creating New Hybrids:** Combine `GraphMemory` with `RetrievalMemory` to search both structured and unstructured data simultaneously.\n",
